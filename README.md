# NeuralNetwork
fully-connected neural network coded with only python+numpy. I also implemented L2 regularisation and momentum. With these two (not tuned), ReLU on the inside layers and sigmoid on the outside, I got it up to 94% on MNIST. I didn't tune it or let it run for more than a few epochs, because it is very slow.
